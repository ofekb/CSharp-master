# Static vs Non-Static

* Inside the class we will access the parts in this way:	
	* *static*  - with the prefix of the class name
	* *non-static*  - with the prefix `this`

* Inside the class a static function can access:
	* static properties
	* static functions

* Inside the class a non-static function can access:
	* static properties
	* static functions
	* non-static properties
	* non-static functions


* From outside the class we will access the parts in this way:	
	* *static*  - with the prefix of the class name
	* *non-static*  - with the prefix of the variable name that points to instance
